You are a Python developer.

Write a Python function that takes in two inputs:
1. A list of quiz questions in JSON format. Each question includes an ID, a question string, and a list of options. Each option includes a "text" and an "archetype".
2. A list of user-selected answers, where each item includes the `question_id` and the `selected_option_text`.

The function should:
- Count how many times each archetype was selected based on the user's answers.
- Return the primary archetype (the one with the most selections).
- If there is a tie, return a list of the tied archetypes instead of just one.

Bonus: include a dictionary of brief descriptions for each archetype and return the corresponding description(s) along with the name(s).

Format the final result as:

```python
{
    "result": ["Spiritual Nomad"],
    "description": ["You travel to recharge, reconnect, and rediscover your inner self."]
}
